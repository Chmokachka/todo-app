# TODO APP with React, Node, Express, mongodb and Redux
> I have made the backend on Express Js and there by the Bcakend serves the static files and the index.html file generated React UI. I have used Redux to store counts of Completed tasks and total tasks between Footer component and the Main app component (TodoApp.js). Backend connects to Database(MongoDB) and has API endpoints.Â 

## Usage:

- Clone the Repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshsinghvi/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
```
- install Dependencies
`npm install`
- build ReactUI FrontEnd `npm run buid`
- set the **MONGO_DB_URI** environment variable so that our backend can access Database `export MONGO_DB_URI="mongodb+srv://<USER>:<PASS>@cluster0.******.mongodb.net/todo-app"` and make a database name `todo-app` and a collection in it names `todos`.
- Run the Server 
`npm start` 
> index.js serves backend and frontend together
